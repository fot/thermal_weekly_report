        <p>
            In April of 2008 the ISIM detector housing heaters were disabled and are expected to remain in this state for the remainder of the mission.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            On April 28th of 2009 the telescope secondary database calibration was changed to reflect the A side calibration with non-critical heater setpoints set to 66F instead of their nominal calibration for the B side heaters. This change allows the secondary database to be used as a contingency option to drain the batteries should Chandra enter a short eclipse too hot. Ensuring the batteries are properly drained prior to exiting a short eclipse will help prevent the power bus from exceeding 35v.    
        </p>        
        
        <p>
            In August of 2009 the ISIM FA6 abort heater was disabled and is expected to remain in this state for the remainder of the mission.
        </p>

        <p>
            On December 8th, 2014, the telescope primary, secondary, and tertiary databases were modified to switch all thermistors that contribute to the OBA_AVE and TSSMAX telescope healthchecks to wide range read mode to prevent several of these thermistors from reaching a temperature saturation point. This change ensures temperatures in these regions will continue to be fully visible for the forseeable future.
